# Lizard Spammer
Pretty simple program. This README is too short to deserve a TL;DR, so you're not gonna get one.

*Warning: Do not use if 2000 png files opened onto your screen might be considered "undesirable".*


**How to use**
1. Download lizardAttack.py program onto you or a friend's computer.
1. Open terminal
1. Navigate to the folder where lizard_spammer.py is housed
1. Type the command "python lizard_spammer.py"
1. Sit back and try to control the intense sensations of euphoria that wash over your body as the lizard, a baby leopard gecko named Chet, populates your screen

*Note: this should be fully functional for both Python versions 2 and 3. Tested on Windows*
